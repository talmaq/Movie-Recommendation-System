# Movie Recommendation System Using Python

This project demonstrates how to build a Movie Recommendation System using various data processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The approach involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of recommendation algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their preferences.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their past interactions or similarities with other users' preferences. By analyzing movie data and user behavior, the system can provide personalized movie recommendations.

### Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction and selection for recommendations
- Implementing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering
- Visualization of recommendation results

## Dataset

- The datasets used in this project are `movies.csv` and `credits.csv`, which contain information about movies and their associated credits.
- **Columns in `movies.csv`:**
  - `title`: The title of the movie.
  - `genres`: Genres associated with the movie.
  - `release_date`: Date when the movie was released.
  - `vote_average`: Average rating of the movie.
  - `overview`: A brief summary of the movie's plot.

- **Columns in `credits.csv`:**
  - `title`: The title of the movie (for joining with the movies dataset).
  - `cast`: List of cast members.
  - `crew`: List of crew members (e.g., directors, producers).

> **Note:** Ensure both `movies.csv` and `credits.csv` datasets are placed in the root directory of the project.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the following Python packages:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

> It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

## Results

- The recommendation system can suggest a list of movies to users based on their preferences.
- Visualization of the recommendation results is provided to show similarities between different movies and users.
